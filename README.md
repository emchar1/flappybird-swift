Learn to make 2D Games for Apple Devices by building a clone of the infamous Flappy Bird with Swift 3.0.

Together we’ll build a complete game step by step using SpriteKit and Swift.

All you need is a Mac and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12">Xcode</a> which can be downloaded for free from the Mac App Store. I’ve provided everything else. Let’s get started!

### Keeping the downloaded source code up to date with changes
1 - Choose a location on your Mac to keep the original source code. In this example we'll make a Source folder in your Documents folder.
```bash
mkdir ~/Documents/Source
```

2 - Clone the flappybird-swift project from GitHub.
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Source && git clone https://github.com/spritekitbook/flappybird-swift.git
```

3 - When you want to sync with the latest version on GitHub.
```bash
cd ~/Documents/Source/flappybird-swift
git fetch origin
git reset —-hard origin/master
```
